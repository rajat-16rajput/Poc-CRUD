          Purskar”. Dowry is a social evil prevailing in our community. J. B.
          Shetty instituted gold medals to newly married outstanding couple i.e.
          those who marry without accepting Dowry. Once a year all the Bunts in
          Pune gather for their annual day, where a renowned member of the
          community is invited as the chief guest.. The guest then bestows the
          medal to the deserving couple. This is indeed an honor for the couple.
          In this way Jagannath Shetty encourages the men in Pune to oppose
          dowry. He has also helped many parents to get their daughters married.
          Though he has settled down in Pune, he has not forgotten his native
          place. he has generously given donations to his old school for
          development, and build the village Ganapathi Temple. Jagannath Shetty
          is an ardent golfer and has Captained Poona golf club in the year
          1997-98”If I dont play golf even for one day, I feel very uneasy”,says
          J.B Shetty. He has won several awards too. He has started an annual
          “Vaishali Cup” for amateurs. He has traveled widely all over the world
          .in all his social activities he had the fullest co-operation of his
          better half late Smt. Shakuntala Shetty. They have a daughter Kum.
          Nikita. There must be something intrinsically astounding in an
          individual who has achieved such heights without the benefit of either
          an academic or technical education. He deserves full appreciation from
          one and all.
